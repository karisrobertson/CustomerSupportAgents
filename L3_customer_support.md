# L3: Multi-agent Customer Support Automation

In this lesson, you will learn about the six key elements which help make Agents perform even better:
- Role Playing
- Focus
- Tools
- Cooperation
- Guardrails
- Memory

The libraries are already installed in the classroom. If you're running this notebook on your own machine, you can install the following:
```Python
!pip install crewai==0.28.8 crewai_tools==0.1.6 langchain_community==0.0.29
```


```python
# Warning control
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```

- Import libraries, API and LLM


```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
```


```python
import os
from utils import get_openai_api_key

openai_api_key = get_openai_api_key()
os.environ["OPENAI_MODEL_NAME"] = 'gpt-3.5-turbo'
```

## Role Playing, Focus and Cooperation


```python
support_agent = Agent(
    role="Senior Support Representative",
	goal="Be the most friendly and helpful "
        "support representative in your team",
	backstory=(
		"You work at crewAI (https://crewai.com) and "
        " are now working on providing "
		"support to {customer}, a super important customer "
        " for your company."
		"You need to make sure that you provide the best support!"
		"Make sure to provide full complete answers, "
        " and make no assumptions."
	),
	allow_delegation=False,
	verbose=True
)
```

- By not setting `allow_delegation=False`, `allow_delegation` takes its default value of being `True`.
- This means the agent _can_ delegate its work to another agent which is better suited to do a particular task. 


```python
support_quality_assurance_agent = Agent(
	role="Support Quality Assurance Specialist",
	goal="Get recognition for providing the "
    "best support quality assurance in your team",
	backstory=(
		"You work at crewAI (https://crewai.com) and "
        "are now working with your team "
		"on a request from {customer} ensuring that "
        "the support representative is "
		"providing the best support possible.\n"
		"You need to make sure that the support representative "
        "is providing full"
		"complete answers, and make no assumptions."
	),
	verbose=True
)
```

* **Role Playing**: Both agents have been given a role, goal and backstory.
* **Focus**: Both agents have been prompted to get into the character of the roles they are playing.
* **Cooperation**: Support Quality Assurance Agent can delegate work back to the Support Agent, allowing for these agents to work together.

## Tools, Guardrails and Memory

### Tools

- Import CrewAI tools


```python
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool, \
                         ScrapeWebsiteTool, \
                         WebsiteSearchTool
```

### Possible Custom Tools
- Load customer data
- Tap into previous conversations
- Load data from a CRM
- Checking existing bug reports
- Checking existing feature requests
- Checking ongoing tickets
- ... and more

- Some ways of using CrewAI tools.

```Python
search_tool = SerperDevTool()
scrape_tool = ScrapeWebsiteTool()
```

- Instantiate a document scraper tool.
- The tool will scrape a page (only 1 URL) of the CrewAI documentation.


```python
docs_scrape_tool = ScrapeWebsiteTool(
    website_url="https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/Creating-a-Crew-and-kick-it-off/"
)
```

##### Different Ways to Give Agents Tools

- Agent Level: The Agent can use the Tool(s) on any Task it performs.
- Task Level: The Agent will only use the Tool(s) when performing that specific Task.

**Note**: Task Tools override the Agent Tools.

### Creating Tasks
- You are passing the Tool on the Task Level.


```python
inquiry_resolution = Task(
    description=(
        "{customer} just reached out with a super important ask:\n"
	    "{inquiry}\n\n"
        "{person} from {customer} is the one that reached out. "
		"Make sure to use everything you know "
        "to provide the best support possible."
		"You must strive to provide a complete "
        "and accurate response to the customer's inquiry."
    ),
    expected_output=(
	    "A detailed, informative response to the "
        "customer's inquiry that addresses "
        "all aspects of their question.\n"
        "The response should include references "
        "to everything you used to find the answer, "
        "including external data or solutions. "
        "Ensure the answer is complete, "
		"leaving no questions unanswered, and maintain a helpful and friendly "
		"tone throughout."
    ),
	tools=[docs_scrape_tool],
    agent=support_agent,
)
```

- `quality_assurance_review` is not using any Tool(s)
- Here the QA Agent will only review the work of the Support Agent


```python
quality_assurance_review = Task(
    description=(
        "Review the response drafted by the Senior Support Representative for {customer}'s inquiry. "
        "Ensure that the answer is comprehensive, accurate, and adheres to the "
		"high-quality standards expected for customer support.\n"
        "Verify that all parts of the customer's inquiry "
        "have been addressed "
		"thoroughly, with a helpful and friendly tone.\n"
        "Check for references and sources used to "
        " find the information, "
		"ensuring the response is well-supported and "
        "leaves no questions unanswered."
    ),
    expected_output=(
        "A final, detailed, and informative response "
        "ready to be sent to the customer.\n"
        "This response should fully address the "
        "customer's inquiry, incorporating all "
		"relevant feedback and improvements.\n"
		"Don't be too formal, we are a chill and cool company "
	    "but maintain a professional and friendly tone throughout."
    ),
    agent=support_quality_assurance_agent,
)

```

### Creating the Crew

#### Memory
- Setting `memory=True` when putting the crew together enables Memory.


```python
crew = Crew(
  agents=[support_agent, support_quality_assurance_agent],
  tasks=[inquiry_resolution, quality_assurance_review],
  verbose=2,
  memory=True
)
```

### Running the Crew

**Note**: LLMs can provide different outputs for they same input, so what you get might be different than what you see in the video.

#### Guardrails
- By running the execution below, you can see that the agents and the responses are within the scope of what we expect from them.


```python
inputs = {
    "customer": "DeepLearningAI",
    "person": "Andrew Ng",
    "inquiry": "I need help with setting up a Crew "
               "and kicking it off, specifically "
               "how can I add memory to my crew? "
               "Can you provide guidance?"
}
result = crew.kickoff(inputs=inputs)
```
